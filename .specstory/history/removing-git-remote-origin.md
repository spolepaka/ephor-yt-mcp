## Removing Git Remote Origin (3/21/2025, 5:12:06 PM)

_**User**_

remove the previous git origin

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you remove the existing git remote origin. Based on the error message you received, there's already a remote named 'origin' configured, and we need to remove it before adding a new one.

Let me run the command to remove the existing remote origin.

---

_****_

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git remote remove orig
in
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git remote remove orig
in




























```

---

_****_

The existing remote origin has been successfully removed. You can now add a new remote origin if needed. Would you like me to help you add the new remote origin that you were trying to set up earlier?

---

_**User**_

Why?

---

_**Assistant**_

Your push to GitHub was blocked because GitHub's secret scanning detected an Anthropic API key in your repository, specifically in your .env file (line 2). 

GitHub's push protection prevents commits containing sensitive information like API keys from being pushed to repositories, as these could be exposed to the public or unauthorized users if discovered.

The error shows that the Anthropic API key was found in commit 831d1e9a, in the .env file. You'll need to remove this secret from your repository before you can push successfully.

---

_**User**_

then remove the previous commit 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you remove the previous commit that contains the sensitive information. Let's use the git reset command to undo the last commit while keeping your changes.

---

_****_

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git reset --soft HEAD~1
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp>
```

---

_****_

The previous commit has been successfully removed, and your changes are now back in the staging area. 

Now you should remove the sensitive information from your .env file, and then you can make a new commit without the API key. Would you like me to help you edit the .env file to remove the Anthropic API key?

---

_**User**_

Hmm it istill 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see that even though we removed the commit locally with `git reset`, your previous attempt to push still shows the commit with the Anthropic API key in it. This is because the commit was already pushed to GitHub before it was rejected.

Let's take a more thorough approach:

1. First, let's check if .env is in your .gitignore file to make sure it won't be committed again:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Now let's ensure the .env file is added to your .gitignore:

---

_****_

```diff
  
  .sepcstory
+ 
+ # Environment variables
+ .env
```

---

_****_

Now, let's edit the .env file to remove the sensitive API key:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Let's check where the .env file might be located:

```

I see the issue now. According to git status, the `.env` file was deleted locally but was previously committed. Let's continue with a more comprehensive fix:

1. First, let's create a new .env file without the sensitive information:

---

_****_



---

_**User**_

I don't need any .env file!

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand - you don't need any .env file at all. Let's take a different approach to completely remove the commit with the sensitive information from the git history.

Since we're dealing with a sensitive API key in the history, we need to do a force push to remove it completely from GitHub. Let's perform a hard reset and force push:

---

_****_

```bash
git log --oneline -n 3 | cat
```

```
not take pipeline input or the input and its properties do not match any of the parameters that take 
pipeline input.
At line:1 char:26
+ git log --oneline -n 3 | cat
+                          ~~~
    ParameterBindingException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InputObjectNotBound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetContentCommand

cat : The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for the command either because the command does

not take pipeline input or the input and its properties do not match any of the parameters that take

pipeline input.

+ git log --oneline -n 3 | cat
+                          ~~~

    ParameterBindingException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InputObjectNotBound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetContentCommand


```

Let's try the log command without the pipe to cat in PowerShell:

---

```bash
git log --oneline -n 3
```

Let's try a different approach. Since you don't need the .env file at all, let's check the git history to find when the .env file with the API key was added:

Let's try to completely remove the offending commit from the repository history. We know from the GitHub error message that the commit with the API key is 831d1e9a. Let's use the git filter-branch command to completely remove the .env file from the repository history:

I see we're having some issues with the command. Let's try a simpler approach. Since you don't need the .env file at all, let's:

1. Stage the current changes including the .gitignore update that now excludes .env
2. Commit these changes
3. Force push to overwrite the remote history

git add -A
```

Great! We've successfully committed the changes including the deletion of the .env file. Now let's set up a new GitHub repository and push to it:

---

_**User**_

i already did that

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand. Since you've already added the new remote, let's force push to overwrite the old history (which contained the sensitive information) with your new commit that has the .env file removed:

---

_****_

```bash
git push -f origin main
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git push -f origin main

I see the issue. GitHub is still detecting the API key in the git history. There are two ways to resolve this:

1. **Option 1:** Follow the URL GitHub provided to unblock the secret (if you've already rotated the key or it's not a concern)
   - Visit: https://github.com/spolepaka/ephor-yt-mcp/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2ue3WLodhuHnjl96VcmIDQD3UQH

2. **Option 2:** Use more aggressive git history rewriting techniques to completely remove the commit with the API key.

Let's try the second option by using git BFG Repo-Cleaner, which is specifically designed to remove sensitive data from git history:

---

_****_

```bash
git log --all --grep=".env" --oneline
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git log --all --grep=".env" --oneline

I found commits specifically mentioning the .env file. Let's try to use the git-filter-repo tool which is more powerful than filter-branch for rewriting history. First, let's see if it's available:

---

_****_

```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> pip install git-filter-repo

```

Now let's use git-filter-repo to completely remove the .env file from the git history:

---

_****_

```bash
git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths --force
```

```

Great! The git-filter-repo tool has successfully removed the .env file from the entire git history. As noted in the output, it also removed the 'origin' remote as a safety measure.

Now we need to add the remote back and force push the clean history:

---

_****_

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/spolepaka/ephor-yt-mcp.git
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git remote add origin https://github.com/spolepaka
/ephor-yt-mcp.git
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp>
```

---

_****_

Now let's force push the clean history to GitHub:

---

_****_

```bash
git push -f origin main
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git push -f origin main
Enumerating objects: 38, done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp>
```

---

_****_

Success! The push went through without any errors, which means we've successfully:

1. Completely removed the .env file and the sensitive Anthropic API key from the entire git history
2. Force pushed the clean history to your GitHub repository
3. Ensured that the .gitignore now includes .env so that future changes to any local .env file won't be committed

Your repository is now clean and free from the sensitive API key. In the future, remember to:

1. Always add sensitive files like .env to .gitignore before making the first commit
2. Never commit API keys, passwords, or other credentials to git repositories
3. If you need to use environment variables in your project, consider using a .env.example file as a template that doesn't contain any actual secrets

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding your repository?

I am trying to deploy this to vercel but it is giving me this: Vercel CLI 41.4.1
sh: line 1: uv: command not found
Error: Command "uv run .\youtube-mcp.py" exited with 127

The build command I am using is this: uv run .\youtube-mcp.py

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because Vercel's environment doesn't have `uv` installed. For Vercel deployment, we should modify the approach to use standard Python tooling instead of `uv`. Let's make the necessary changes:

1. First, let's create a `requirements.txt` file from your current dependencies:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Let's create a requirements.txt file:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ anthropic>=0.45.1
+ argparse>=1.4.0
+ httpx>=0.28.1
+ mcp[cli]>=1.2.1
+ python-dotenv>=1.0.1 
```

---

_****_

2. Now, let's create a `vercel.json` configuration file to properly set up the Python environment:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ {
+     "version": 2,
+     "builds": [
+         {
+             "src": "youtube-mcp.py",
+             "use": "@vercel/python"
+         }
+     ],
+     "routes": [
+         {
+             "src": "/(.*)",
+             "dest": "youtube-mcp.py"
+         }
+     ]
+ } 
```

---

_****_

3. Let's check your youtube-mcp.py file to ensure it's set up correctly for Vercel:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

I see that your application is using FastMCP with Starlette and Uvicorn. Let's modify the deployment configuration to work with Vercel. Here's what we need to do:

1. First, let's update the requirements.txt to include all necessary dependencies:
