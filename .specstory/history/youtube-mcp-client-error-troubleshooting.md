I see the issue. The YouTube MCP server is running on port 8080, but your client is trying to connect to port 3000, causing the ECONNREFUSED error. Let's check the client configuration to fix this port mismatch.

Now I understand what's happening. The issue is that in the Cursor IDE, the YouTube MCP tool is configured to connect to "http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse" but it's trying to connect to port 3000 instead (according to the error message).

Let's fix this by checking if there's a configuration file for the MCP client in Cursor:

The solution is straightforward. The YouTube MCP server is running on port 8080, but your client in Cursor is trying to connect to port 3000. Here's how to fix it:

1. Make sure your YouTube MCP server is running on port 8080:

no idea why cursor is trzing to connect on port 3000 i explicitly give it  in the url

This is an interesting problem. Even though your configuration file at `c:\Users\Suman\.cursor\mcp.json` correctly specifies "http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse", Cursor is still trying to connect on port 3000.

There are a few possible solutions:

1. Try using localhost instead of 0.0.0.0:
   - Edit your configuration to use `"url": "http://localhost:8080/sse"`

2. Change your server to run on port 3000 instead:
   - Run the server with `uv run youtube-mcp.py --port 3000`

3. Check if Cursor has any other configuration files that might be overriding your setting:
   - Look for a workspace-specific `.cursor` folder that might contain configuration

4. Try restarting Cursor after making the configuration change

5. As a temporary test, try editing the YouTube MCP server code to log the client connection attempts to see what's happening on the server side

Since Cursor seems to be hardcoded to use port 3000 for some reason, the simplest solution would be to run your server on port 3000 to match what Cursor expects.

Here is the transcript from the video "Will Artificial General Intelligence DESTROY Middle Class Jobs":

The video discusses how AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) could transform society, particularly its impact on middle-class jobs. Key points from the transcript:

1. Introduction (0:00-1:00): Describes a future with self-driving cars, robot chefs, and AI assistants handling mundane tasks, calling this a "double-edged sword" that offers efficiency but raises concerns about work.

2. Historical Context (1:00-2:00): Notes that technological advancements have historically created more jobs than they displaced (Agricultural Revolution, internet boom), but AGI presents a unique challenge by automating cognitive tasks.

3. Middle Class Impact (2:00-3:00): Cites McKinsey and Oxford University studies predicting widespread job automation in roles requiring routine cognitive skills. Examples include AI radiologists analyzing medical images and AI legal assistants.

4. Economic Inequality (3:00-4:00): Warns that AGI could widen the gap between "haves and have-nots" if technology primarily creates jobs requiring advanced skills while eliminating middle-class positions.

5. Solutions (4:00-6:00):
   - Education reform to foster critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence
   - Retraining programs for mid-career professionals
   - Government policies balancing innovation with public interest
   - Social safety nets like universal basic income
   - Business investment in reskilling employees

6. Call to Action (6:30-7:30): Emphasizes the need for proactive measures, encouraging viewers to "take control of your destiny" by investing in education and continuously updating skills.

The video concludes that the future of work with AGI isn't predetermined but will be shaped by choices made today.

- # SSE-based Server and Client for [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
+ # YouTube MCP Server
+ 
+ An SSE-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides YouTube search and video data capabilities.
  
- [![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@sidharthrajaram/mcp-sse)](https://smithery.ai/server/@sidharthrajaram/mcp-sse)
+ ## Features
  
- This demonstrates a working pattern for SSE-based MCP servers and standalone MCP clients that use tools from them. Based on an original discussion [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/145).
- 
- ## Usage
- 
- **Note**: Make sure to supply `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` or as an environment variable.
- 
- ```
- uv run weather.py
- 
- uv run client.py http://0.0.0.0:8080/sse
- ```
- 
- ```
- Initialized SSE client...
- Listing tools...
- 
- Connected to server with tools: ['get_alerts', 'get_forecast']
- 
- MCP Client Started!
- Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.
- 
- Query: whats the weather like in Spokane?
- 
- I can help you check the weather forecast for Spokane, Washington. I'll use the get_forecast function, but I'll need to use Spokane's latitude and longitude coordinates.
- 
- Spokane, WA is located at approximately 47.6587Â° N, 117.4260Â° W.
- [Calling tool get_forecast with args {'latitude': 47.6587, 'longitude': -117.426}]
- Based on the current forecast for Spokane:
- 
- Right now it's sunny and cold with a temperature of 37Â°F and ...
+ This server provides the following tools to AI models via the MCP protocol:
+ 
+ - **search**: Search for YouTube videos with customizable result limits
+ - **get_video_info**: Get detailed information about a specific YouTube video
+ - **get_transcript**: Retrieve transcript data from YouTube videos
+ 
+ ## Installation
+ 
+ 1. Clone this repository
+ 2. Install dependencies with uv:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ uv pip install httpx mcp starlette uvicorn
+ ```
+ 
+ Or alternatively:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- ## Why?
- 
- This means the MCP server can now be some running process that agents (clients) connect to, use, and disconnect from whenever and wherever they want. In other words, an SSE-based server and clients can be decoupled processes (potentially even, on decoupled nodes). This is different and better fits "cloud-native" use-cases compared to the STDIO-based pattern where the client itself spawns the server as a subprocess.
- 
- ### Installing via Smithery

Why doens't the uv command that i am running force quit even after i use ctrl+c? I have to now manually kill the terminal!

---

_**Assistant**_

You're encountering a known issue where Uvicorn's signal handling might not always work perfectly with `CTRL+C`, especially on Windows. Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how to address it:

**Why it Happens**

*   **Signal Handling Complexity:** Handling signals (like `SIGINT` from `CTRL+C`) is inherently complex, and the interaction between Python, Uvicorn, and the operating system's terminal can lead to inconsistencies.  Windows, in particular, has different signal handling mechanisms compared to Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS).
*   **Uvicorn's Lifespan Management:** Uvicorn has a "lifespan" feature (`lifespan="on"` by default in your `youtube-mcp.py`) that manages startup and shutdown events.  This can sometimes interfere with the immediate termination you expect from `CTRL+C`.  The server is waiting for connections to close gracefully.
*   **Underlying Event Loop:** Uvicorn uses an asynchronous event loop (like `asyncio`).  Sometimes, the way the event loop is structured or how tasks are scheduled can delay the processing of the interrupt signal.
*   **Connected Clients:** If there are active client connections (even seemingly idle ones), Uvicorn might wait for them to disconnect gracefully before shutting down completely.  This is the behavior you're seeing with the "Waiting for connections to close" message.

**Solutions and Explanations**

1.  **Double Ctrl+C (Most Common Fix):**  Often, pressing `CTRL+C` *twice* in rapid succession will force a more immediate shutdown.  The first `CTRL+C` sends the initial interrupt, and the second one can override the graceful shutdown process.

2.  **`--no-lifespan` (Uvicorn Option):**  You can disable Uvicorn's lifespan management, which *might* improve `CTRL+C` responsiveness.  Modify your run command:

    ```bash
    uv run youtube-mcp.py --port 3000 --no-lifespan
    ```

    This tells Uvicorn not to wait for the lifespan events (startup/shutdown) and can make it more responsive to signals.  However, it might also prevent proper cleanup in some cases, so test it carefully.

3.  **Explicit Signal Handler (Best Practice, but More Involved):** The most robust solution is to implement a more sophisticated signal handler within your `youtube-mcp.py` file.  Your current code *has* a signal handler, but it's very basic:

    ```python:youtube-mcp.py
    # Define signal handler for graceful shutdown
    def signal_handler(sig, frame):
        print("\nShutting down server gracefully...")
        sys.exit(0)

    # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # ...
        # Register signal handler for Ctrl+C
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
        # ...
        uvicorn.run(starlette_app, host=args.host, port=args.port, lifespan="on")
    ```

    The problem is that `sys.exit(0)` within a signal handler doesn't always immediately terminate a Uvicorn server running with `lifespan="on"`.  A better approach involves interacting with the Uvicorn server instance more directly.  Here's a more complete example, and I'll explain the key parts:

    ```python:youtube-mcp.py
    import signal
    import sys
    import uvicorn
    from starlette.applications import Starlette
    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
    from mcp.server.sse import SseServerTransport
    from starlette.requests import Request
    from starlette.routing import Mount, Route, Router
    from mcp.server import Server
    import argparse

    # ... (rest of your imports and tool definitions) ...

    # Global variable to hold the Uvicorn server instance
    server: uvicorn.Server | None = None

    def create_starlette_app(mcp_server: Server, *, debug: bool = False) -> Starlette:
        # ... (your existing create_starlette_app function) ...
        return Starlette(
            # ...
        )

    def signal_handler(sig, frame):
        global server
        print("\nShutting down server gracefully...")
        if server:
            # This is the key part:  Forcefully stop the event loop.
            server.force_exit = True
            # If you're using websockets or long-polling, you might also need:
            # server.should_exit = True
        sys.exit(0)  # Still a good idea to exit

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        mcp_server = mcp._mcp_server  # noqa: WPS437

        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run YouTube MCP SSE-based server')
        parser.add_argument('--host', default='0.0.0.0', help='Host to bind to')
        parser.add_argument('--port', type=int, default=8080, help='Port to listen on')
        args = parser.parse_args()

        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

        print("YouTube Search MCP Server starting...")
        print(f"Server running at http://{args.host}:{args.port}")
        print("Use Ctrl+C to stop the server")
        print("Client command: uv run client.py http://localhost:8080/sse")
        print("Questions or feedback? Connect with @spolepaka/youtube-mcp | X: @skpolepaka")

        starlette_app = create_starlette_app(mcp_server, debug=True)

        # Create a Uvicorn config and server instance *manually*.
        config = uvicorn.Config(
            app=starlette_app,
            host=args.host,
            port=args.port,
            lifespan="on",  # Or "auto" if you want to experiment
        )
        server = uvicorn.Server(config)
        server.run()
    ```

    Key changes and explanations:

    *   **Global `server` Variable:** We create a global variable `server` to store the `uvicorn.Server` instance.  This allows the signal handler to access it.
    *   **Manual Uvicorn Configuration:** Instead of using `uvicorn.run` directly, we create a `uvicorn.Config` object and then a `uvicorn.Server` instance.  This gives us more control.
    *   **`server.force_exit = True`:**  This is the most important part.  Inside the `signal_handler`, we set `server.force_exit = True`.  This tells Uvicorn to stop accepting new connections and to exit as soon as possible.
    *   **`server.should_exit = True`:**  For some connection types (like WebSockets), you might also need to set `server.should_exit = True`.  This signals to the server that it should shut down.
    *  **`lifespan="on"` or `"auto"`:** You can still use lifespan management, but the signal handler now has a way to override it.

4.  **Task Manager/Activity Monitor (Last Resort):** If all else fails, you can always use your operating system's task manager (Task Manager on Windows, Activity Monitor on macOS, `top` or `htop` on Linux) to find and kill the Python process that's running the Uvicorn server.  This is a brute-force method, but it will work.

**Recommendation**

I strongly recommend trying the **improved signal handler** (option 3) first. It's the most reliable and gives you the most control over the shutdown process.  If that doesn't work, try the double `CTRL+C` or the `--no-lifespan` option. The Task Manager method should be your last resort.

The improved signal handler gives you a clean way to interrupt the server, even if it's busy handling requests or waiting for connections to close. It's the best practice for production deployments as well.
