## Connection Timeout Error Resolution (3/21/2025, 6:16:49 PM)

_**User**_

The error you're now seeing is a connection timeout error:

Based on this error message:
The Cursor IDE's MCP client is attempting to connect to IP addresses 216.198.79.65 and 64.29.17.65 on port 8080, but these connection attempts are timing out after 10 seconds.
Despite starting your server on port 3000 with uv run youtube-mcp.py --port 3000, the client is still trying to connect to port 8080.
Looking at the code, I can see the issue is in the URL paths. In your create_starlette_app function, you're setting up routes including /sse, but the error message suggests Cursor is trying to connect to a different port (8080) than the one your server is running on (3000).
In the server output, you can see the server successfully started on port 3000 and is accepting connections, but the client is trying to connect to a different port/address.
The issue appears to be a mismatch between where your server is running and where Cursor is configured to look for the MCP server.

You've correctly identified the core issue: a mismatch between the server's port (3000) and the client's connection attempt (port 8080). You also correctly noted that the server log shows it's running on port 3000 and receiving requests, but the client is trying to connect elsewhere.

The provided information highlights the problem, but doesn't give the code to fix. Since you're using Cursor, I'll assume you want to keep the server running on port 3000. The fix needs to be in how the client is started, to tell it to connect to port 3000 instead of 8080. The relevant line from the server output is:

```
Client command: uv run client.py http://localhost:8080/sse
```

This shows that the `client.py` script is being *told* to connect to `http://localhost:8080/sse`.  We need to change that `8080` to `3000`. I don't have the `client.py` code, but I can tell you what needs to change in the command you use to run the client.

You should change the client command to:

```
uv run client.py http://localhost:3000/sse
```

This will tell the client to connect to the correct port where your server is running. If `client.py` takes the URL as a command-line argument (as shown in the server log), then this change to the command is all you need.

If the URL is hardcoded *inside* `client.py`, you'd need to edit `client.py` itself.  Since I don't have that file, I can't give you the exact code change, but you would look for a line similar to:

```python
server_url = "http://localhost:8080/sse"
```

and change it to:

```python
server_url = "http://localhost:3000/sse"
```

In summary, the core problem is the client connecting to the wrong port. You can fix this by changing the command you use to start the client, or, if the URL is hardcoded within the client script, by modifying the client script directly.

there is no client.py code where are you getting it from? refresh the codebase

You are absolutely correct. My apologies, I was hallucinating the `client.py` file based on the server log output and the error message. I should have stated that I was making an assumption and asked you for more information about how the client is configured. I have no codebase context here, so I am working with limited information.

Let's re-examine the situation without assuming a `client.py`. The core problem remains the same: the Cursor MCP client is trying to connect to the wrong port (8080), while your server is running on port 3000.

Since I don't know *how* the Cursor MCP client is being configured or started, I can only give you general guidance. You need to find where the target URL (including the port) for the MCP connection is set within your Cursor setup. This could be in:

1.  **Cursor Settings/Configuration:** Look for settings within the Cursor IDE related to "MCP", "Multi-Cursor Protocol", or "Remote Server". There might be a place to specify the server address and port. You would need to change the port from 8080 to 3000 there.

2.  **Project-Specific Configuration:** Some IDEs allow project-specific settings. Check if your project has any configuration files (e.g., `.cursor` or similar) that might contain the MCP server URL.

3.  **Command-Line Arguments (if applicable):** If you are launching Cursor or the MCP client from a command line, there might be command-line arguments that specify the server URL. Review any scripts or commands you use to start Cursor.

4. **Environment Variables:** It is possible, though less common, that the MCP client is reading the server URL from an environment variable.

I cannot give you the precise steps without knowing more about your Cursor setup. I highly recommend checking the Cursor documentation for "MCP" or "Multi-Cursor Protocol" to find the correct way to configure the server address.

If you can provide more details about how you are starting the MCP client within Cursor, or any relevant configuration files, I might be able to give you more specific instructions. You should try agent mode which can look through your codebase to find relevant information.

it doesn't matter the error is somehow on our end...

_**Assistant**_

Okay, if you're certain the issue is on the server-side (despite the error message clearly indicating a client-side connection timeout to the wrong port), let's focus on what we *can* control and verify on the server. I'll go through a checklist of things to examine in your `youtube-mcp.py` code, and suggest potential changes. Since I don't have the full code, I'll have to make some educated guesses, but I'll explain the reasoning.

1. **Explicit Host Binding:** The most common cause of this kind of issue, even if the port *seems* correct, is that the server isn't explicitly bound to the correct network interface.  By default, Starlette/Uvicorn might bind to `localhost` (127.0.0.1), which *might* not be accessible to external connections, depending on your network configuration and how Cursor's MCP client is running.

   To fix this, make sure you're explicitly binding to `0.0.0.0`. This tells the server to listen on *all* available network interfaces, making it accessible from anywhere (including potentially from within Cursor, even if it's running in a separate container or process).

   Here's how you would modify your `uvicorn.run` call (or your `create_starlette_app` function if that's where the server is configured):

   ```python:youtube-mcp.py
   import uvicorn
   from starlette.applications import Starlette
   from starlette.responses import StreamingResponse
   from starlette.routing import Route
   import asyncio

   async def sse(request):
       async def event_stream():
           count = 0
           while True:
               count += 1
               yield f"data: {count}\n\n"
               await asyncio.sleep(1)

       return StreamingResponse(event_stream(), media_type="text/event-stream")

   routes = [
       Route("/sse", sse),
   ]

   app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=routes)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Use host="0.0.0.0" to bind to all interfaces.
       uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=3000)
   ```

   By explicitly setting `host="0.0.0.0"`, we ensure the server is accessible.

2. **Firewall Issues:** Even with the correct binding, a firewall (either on your machine or on your network) could be blocking connections to port 3000.  This is less likely if other connections to your machine are working, but it's worth checking.  Temporarily disable any firewalls you have running and see if that resolves the issue.  If it does, you'll need to configure your firewall to allow connections to port 3000. I can't give specific instructions for this, as it depends on your operating system and firewall software.

3. **Double-Check the Port:** It's simple, but worth double-checking: make *absolutely sure* there isn't another process already listening on port 3000.  You can use command-line tools like `netstat` (on Windows) or `lsof` (on Linux/macOS) to check for this.  If something else is using port 3000, you'll need to either stop that process or configure your MCP server to use a different port (and then, of course, make sure Cursor is configured to connect to *that* port).

4. **Simplified Test Case:** Create the *simplest possible* Starlette application that just has the `/sse` endpoint and nothing else. This helps isolate the problem. The code I provided above in step 1 is already a very simplified example. Try running *just that* code and see if Cursor can connect to it. If it *can*, then the issue is likely something else in your `youtube-mcp.py` file that's interfering. If it *can't*, then the problem is more fundamental (network, firewall, or Cursor configuration).

5. **Logging:** Add more logging to your server. Print out when the server starts, when a client connects, and any errors that occur. This can give you more visibility into what's happening.

   ```python:youtube-mcp.py
   import uvicorn
   from starlette.applications import Starlette
   from starlette.responses import StreamingResponse
   from starlette.routing import Route
   import asyncio
   import logging

   # Configure logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   async def sse(request):
       logger.info("SSE endpoint accessed")
       async def event_stream():
           count = 0
           while True:
               count += 1
               logger.info(f"Sending event: {count}")
               yield f"data: {count}\n\n"
               await asyncio.sleep(1)

       return StreamingResponse(event_stream(), media_type="text/event-stream")

   routes = [
       Route("/sse", sse),
   ]

   app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=routes)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       logger.info("Starting server on port 3000")
       uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=3000)
   ```

By systematically checking these points, you should be able to narrow down the cause of the connection problem, even if it's ultimately on the server-side. However, I still strongly suspect the issue is with the Cursor client configuration, given the error message.

hmm analyze whats going on think deep and hard!

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your screenshot and the complete code, I can see exactly what's happening. The problem is a discrepancy between:

1. Where your server is running (configured in your code)
2. Where Cursor is looking for your server (per the error in the screenshot)

Let's look at the key parts of your code:

```367:378:youtube-mcp.py
# Create a router to handle root path
async def root_handler(request: Request):
    from starlette.responses import HTMLResponse
    return HTMLResponse("""
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>YouTube MCP Server</title>
            <style>
                body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 40px; line-height: 1.6; }
                code { background: #f4f4f4; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px; }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>YouTube MCP Server</h1>
            <p>Server is running successfully.</p>
            <p>To connect, use: <code>uv run client.py http://localhost:8080/sse</code></p>
```

And near the end of your file:

```430:434:youtube-mcp.py
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run YouTube MCP SSE-based server')
parser.add_argument('--host', default='0.0.0.0', help='Host to bind to')
parser.add_argument('--port', type=int, default=8080, help='Port to listen on')
args = parser.parse_args()
```

The issue is: your code's default port is 8080, but from your screenshot, I can see you're running the server with `--port 3000`, changing it to port 3000.

However, when I look at the screenshot, I see:
- Server Link: http://0.0.0.0:3000/sse (correct, matching your command)
- SSE error: TyperError: fetch failed: Connect Timeout Error (attempted addresses: 216.198.79.65:8080, 64.29.17.65:8080, timeout: 10000ms)

This means:
1. Your server is running correctly on port 3000
2. Cursor is trying to connect to port 8080 on some remote IP addresses

The solution is to modify your Cursor MCP configuration to point to port 3000 instead of 8080. Looking at your code, there's even a message that tells you exactly this:

```440:445:youtube-mcp.py
# Add warning for port 3000 mismatch
if args.port != 3000:
    print("\nNOTE: If you're using Cursor IDE's built-in MCP client:")
    print("  - Cursor might be trying to connect on port 3000 by default")
    print(f"  - Either update your Cursor MCP config to use port {args.port}")
    print("  - Or restart this server with: uv run youtube-mcp.py --port 3000")
    print("  - Config location: ~/.cursor/mcp.json")
```

You need to find and edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` to point to port 3000 instead of 8080. Based on your screenshot, Cursor is looking for the MCP server at those specific IP addresses on port 8080, not at your local server on port 3000.

Alternatively, you could simply restart your server on port 8080 (the default) by omitting the `--port 3000` argument.
