check if we have git remote set up

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the git remote configuration for your repository.

---

_****_

```bash
git remote -v | cat
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git remote -v | cat
cat : The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for the command either
because the command does 
not take pipeline input or the input and its properties do not match any of the
parameters that take 
pipeline input.

+ git remote -v | cat

GetContentCommand


```

Let me try again without the `| cat` since we're in PowerShell:

---

_****_

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp> git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/spolepaka/ephor-yt-mcp.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/spolepaka/ephor-yt-mcp.git (push)
PS C:\Users\Suman\Desktop\Gauntlet_Code\mcp\ephor-yt-mcp>
```

---

_****_

Yes, you have a git remote set up! The repository is configured with:

- Remote name: `origin`
- URL: `https://github.com/spolepaka/ephor-yt-mcp.git`
- Both fetch and push are configured to the same URL

This means your local repository is properly linked to the remote repository on GitHub. You can use commands like `git push` and `git pull` to synchronize with this remote repository.

Would you like to do anything else with the git configuration?
